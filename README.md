# virtual_mk14
This code emulates a Science Of Cambride MK14.
It is a port of Paul Robson's DOS code and Thommy Thorn's code for the NASCOM 2

You need SDL1.2 installed to build this code.

It was a very simple microprocessor trainer board. 
I brought one about 40 years ago.

At the time it was probably the first programable computer I had access to.

This project is a chance to expriment with simulating a microprocessor, display and keyboard.
